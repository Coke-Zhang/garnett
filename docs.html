      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Garnett is a software package that faciliates automated cell type classification from single-cell expression
        data. Garnett works by taking single-cell data, along with a cell type definition (marker) file, and training
        a regression-based classifier. Once a classifier is trained for a tissue/sample type, it can be applied to
        classify future datasets from similar tissues. In addition to describing training and classifying functions,
        this website aims to be a repository of previously trained classifiers.
      </p>

      <h2> Installing Garnett </h2>
      <p>
        Garnett runs in the <a href= "http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical computing environment</a>. You will need
        R version 3.5 or higher to install Garnett.
      </p>
      <h3> Install from Github </h3>
      <p>
        To install Garnett directly from the Github repository, use the following instructions:
      </p>
      <p>
        Garnett builds upon a package called <a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/">Monocle</a>.
        Before installing Garnett, first install Monocle using Bioconductor: 
        # First install Bioconductor and Monocle

{% highlight R %}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install()
BiocManager::install(c("monocle"))

# Next install a few more dependencies
BiocManager::install(c('DelayedArray', 'DelayedMatrixStats', 'org.Hs.eg.db', 'org.Mm.eg.db'))
{% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        You're now ready to install Garnett:
      </p>

      {% highlight R %}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cole-trapnell-lab/garnett")
{% endhighlight %}
      <h3> Load Garnett </h3>
      <p>
        After installation, test that Garnett installed correctly by opening a new R session and typing:
      </p>
      {% highlight R %}library(garnett){% endhighlight %}

      <h2> Getting help </h2>
      <p>
        Questions about Garnett should be posted on our
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/garnett-users">Google Group</a>. Please do not email technical
        questions to Garnett contributors directly.
      </p>

      <h2>Garnett overview</h2>

          <div class= "text-center">
              <img src= "/garnett/images/flow_chart.png">
            </div>
            <p>
        The Garnett workflow has two major parts, each described in detail below:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Train/obtain the classifier:</strong> Either download an existing classifier, or train your own.
            To train, Garnett parses a marker file, chooses a set of training cells, and then trains a
            multinomial classifier to distinguish cell types.</li>
          <li><strong>Classify cells:</strong> Next, Garnett applies the classifier to a set of cells to generate cell 
            type assignments. Optionally, Garnett will expand classifications to similar cells to generate a separate 
            set of cluster-extended type assignments.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>1a. Using a pre-trained classifier</h2>
      <p>
        There are two options for the first part of the Garnett workflow: using a pre-trained classifier, or generating
        your own classifier.
      </p>
      <div class= "text-center">
          <img src= "/garnett/images/flow_chart_pretrained.png">
        </div>
      <p>
        We have generated a series of pre-trained classifiers for various organisms and tissues. If a pre-trained
        classifier exists for your data type, we recommend you try it. The list of available classifiers can be found
        <a href="/garnett/classifiers">here</a>. We hope to continually update and add new classifiers as we
        generate them. We also accept classifiers generated by others - please submit any classifiers you make and help
        build the community! Details on how to submit your classifier are can be found
        <a href="/garnett/docs#submitting-a-classifier">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>To use a pre-trained classifier, first download the classifier, and then load it into your R session using:</p>
{% highlight R %}
load("classifier_name")
{% endhighlight %}

      <p>Once you've loaded the classifier, go on to part 2,
        <a href="/garnett/docs#2-classifying-your-cells">Classifying your cells</a></p>
      <h2>1b. Train your own classifier</h2>
      <div class= "text-center">
          <img src= "/garnett/images/flow_chart_train.png">
        </div>
      <p>
        If a classifier doesn't exist for your tissue type, or doesn't include the cell types you expect in your data,
        then you'll need to generate your own.
      </p>

      <h3>Loading your data</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to train your classifier is to load your single-cell data.
      </p>
      <h4>The CellDataSet class</h4>
      <p>
        Because Garnett builds on <a href = "http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release">Monocle</a>, data for
        Garnett is held in objects of the <code><a href = "https://rdrr.io/bioc/monocle/man/CellDataSet.html">
        CellDataSet (CDS)</a></code> class. This class is derived from the Bioconductor <code>ExpressionSet</code>
        class, which provides a common interface familiar to those who have analyzed microarray experiments with
        Bioconductor. Monocle provides detailed documentation about how to generate an input CDS
        <a href = "http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/docs/#the-celldataset-class">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, Garnett includes a small dataset derived from the PBMC 10x V1 expression
        <a href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/">data</a> [1].
      </p>

{% highlight R %}
# load in the data
# NOTE: the 'system.file' file name is only necessary to read in
# included package data
#
mat <- readMM(system.file("extdata", "exprs_sparse.mtx", package = "garnett"))
fdata <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "fdata.txt", package = "garnett"))
pdata <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "pdata.txt", package = "garnett"),
                    sep="\t")
row.names(mat) <- row.names(fdata)
colnames(mat) <- row.names(pdata)

# create a new CDS object
pd <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", data = pdata)
fd <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", data = fdata)
pbmc_cds <- newCellDataSet(as(mat, "dgCMatrix"),
                             phenoData = pd,
                             featureData = fd)

# generate size factors for normalization later
pbmc_cds <- estimateSizeFactors(pbmc_cds)
{% endhighlight %}

      <h3>Constructing a marker file</h3>
      <p>
        Besides the expression data, the second major input you'll need is a marker file . The
        marker file contains a list of cell type definitions written in an easy-to-read text format. The cell type
        definitions tell Garnett how to choose cells to train the model on. Each cell type definition starts with a
        <strong>'>'</strong> symbol and the cell type name, followed by a series of lines with definition information.
        Definition lines start with a keyword and a <strong>':'</strong> and entries are separated by a comma. Note:
        the Garnett syntax allows for entries following the ':' to move onto following lines however, you may not move
        to a new line mid entry (i.e. you can go to a new line only after a comma).
      </p>
      <p>A simple valid example:</p>
{% highlight text %}
>B cells
expressed: CD19, MS4A1

>T cells
expressed: CD3D
{% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        There are several ways to define cell types in the Garnett marker file format. In general, each cell's
        definition can have three major components. Only the first component is required.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Define the expression</strong></h4>
      <p>
        The first and most important specification for a cell type is its expression. Garnett offers several options
        for specifying marker genes, detailed below.
      </p>

      <div class= "panel panel-info">
        <div class= "panel-heading">
          <h4 class= "panel-title">Recommended expression specifications</h4>
        </div>
        <div class= "panel-body">
          <table class= "table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Format</th>
                <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><code>expressed: gene1, gene2</code></td>
                <td><code>expressed: MYOD1, MYH3</code></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>not expressed: gene1, gene2</code></td>
                <td><code>not expressed: PAX6, PAX3</code></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is the default way to specify marker genes for your cell types. When using this specification, Garnett
        calculates a marker score for each cell, accounting for potential leakage, overall expression levels, and read
        depth. <code>expressed:</code> markers should be specific to the cell type being defined.
      </p>

      <div class= "panel panel-success">
        <div class= "panel-heading">
          <h4 class= "panel-title">Alternative expression specifications</h4>
        </div>
        <div class= "panel-body">
          <table class= "table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Format</th>
                <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><code>expressed above: gene1 value, gene2 value</code></td>
                <td><code>expressed above: MYOD1 4.2, MYH3 700</code></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>expressed below: gene1 value, gene2 value</code></td>
                <td><code>expressed below: PAX6 20, PAX3 4</code></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>expressed between: gene1 value1 value2, gene2 value1 value2</code></td>
                <td><code>expressed between: PAX6 10 20, PAX3 4 100</code></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is an alternative way to specify expression, which can be useful if you know an exact range you expect the
        expression of a gene to occupy. In general however, we do not recommend using these specifications because they
        will not account for read depth and overall expression in each cell. Values are in the same units as your input
        data.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Define the meta data</strong></h4>
      <p>
        In addition to expression information, you can further refine your cell type definitions using meta data. This
        is also where you will specify any subtypes you expect in your data.
      </p>

      <div class= "panel panel-info">
        <div class= "panel-heading">
          <h4 class= "panel-title">Meta data specifications</h4>
        </div>
        <div class= "panel-body">
          <table class= "table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Format</th>
                <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><code>subtype of: celltype</code></td>
                <td><code>subtype of: T cells</code></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>custom meta data: attribute1, attribute2</code></td>
                <td><code>tissue: spleen, thymus</code></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <code>subtype of:</code> allows you to specify that a cell type is a subtype of another cell type in your
        definition file.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>custom meta data:</code> specification allows you to provide any further meta data requirements for your
        cell type. Any column in the <code>pData</code> table of your CDS object can be used as a meta data
        specification. In the example above, there would be a column in the <code>pData</code> table called "tissue".
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Provide your evidence</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Lastly, we highly recommend that you document how you chose your marker definitions. To make it easier to keep
        track of, we provide an additional specification - <code>references:</code> - that will store your citation
        information for each cell type. Add a set of URLs or DOIs and they will be included in your classifier. See
        <a href="/garnett/docs#viewing-references">here</a> for functions to get access to this information.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Add any comments</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Similar to R code, we have included a comment character <code>#</code> so you can add notes/comments in your
        marker file. Anything after a <code>#</code> on the same line will be ignored by Garnett.
      </p>

{% endhighlight %}


      <h3>Checking your markers</h3>
      <p>
        Because defining the marker file is often the hardest part of the process, Garnett includes functions to check
        whether your markers are likely to work well. The two functions relevant are <code>check_markers</code> and
        <code>plot_markers</code>. <code>check_markers</code> generates a table of information about your markers and
        <code>plot_markers</code> plots the most relevant information.
      </p>

    <p>
      In addition to the small included dataset, we have included two example marker files with the package. Here are
    the contents of "pbmc_bad_markers.txt"
    </p>
{% highlight text %}
>B cells
expressed: CD19, MS4A1, CD79A, ACTN, ACTB

{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      Besides the CDS object and the path to the marker file, there are a few arguments to add:
      <ul>
        <li><code>db</code>: <code>db</code> is a required argument for a Bioconductor AnnotationDb-class package used
          for converting gene IDs. For example, for humans use 
          <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.8/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html">org.Hs.eg.db</a>. See 
          available packages at the
          <a href = "http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.8/data/annotation/">Bioconductor website</a>. Load your chosen
        db using <code>library(db)</code>.</li>
        <li><code>cds_gene_id_type</code>: This argument tells Garnett the format of the gene IDs in your CDS object.
        It should be one of the values in <code>columns(db)</code>. The default is "ENSEMBL".</li>
        <li><code>marker_file_gene_id_type</code>: Similarly to above, this argument tells Garnett the format of the
        gene IDs in your marker file.</li>
      </ul>
      After generating your marker_check data.frame, you can use our built in plotting function
      <code>plot_markers</code> to view the results.
    </p>
{% highlight R %}
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
marker_file_path <- system.file("extdata", "pbmc_bad_markers.txt",
                                package = "garnett")
marker_check <- check_markers(pbmc_cds, marker_file_path,
                              db=org.Hs.eg.db,
                              cds_gene_id_type = "SYMBOL",
                              marker_file_gene_id_type = "SYMBOL")

plot_markers(marker_check)
{% endhighlight %}

<div class= "text-center">
    <img src= "/garnett-/images/marker_check.png">
</div>
    <p>
      This marker plot provides some key information about whether the chosen markers are good. First, The red note
      'not in db' lets us know that the marker ACTN was not present as a 'SYMBOL' in the <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.8/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html">org.Hs.eg.db</a> annotation. In this
      case, it's a typo. Next, the x-axis shows the ambiguity score for each of the markers - a measure of how many cells
      receive ambiguous labels when this marker is included - in this case, ACTB and PTPRC have high ambiguity and should
      be excluded. The last piece of relevant information is what percent of all the cells nominated in a cell type were
      chosen because of that marker. This is indicated by color.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> The values output by <code>check_markers</code> and plotted by <code>plot_markers</code> 
      are <strong>estimates</strong> of the numbers of cells that <strong>could</strong> be chosen by the classifier. 
      However, it uses heuristics to quickly find candidate cells, and will not exactly match the cells that are chosen 
      by the marker. Please use the numbers as relative measures, rather than absolute representations of the training 
      set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>A further note on ambiguity scores:</strong> Ambiguity scores are the fraction of the cells a marker nominates 
      that a become labeled as "Ambiguous" when that marker is included in the marker file. However, a high ambiguity 
      score does not necessarily mean that a given marker is not specific. It could mean that a different marker is the 
      culprit, but that marker also nominates a lot of otherwise unlabeled cells (high nomination rate). Look closely 
      at both the marker with a high ambiguity score, and markers in the cell type that it is most ambiguous with 
      before deciding which marker to exclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      After making a marker plot, you may want to revise your marker file. In our toy example, we'll remove ACTN, ACTB 
      and PTPRC to get our final 'pbmc_test.txt' marker file.
    </p>

      <h4>Train the classifier</h4>
      <p>
        Now it's time to train the classifier. The arguments should be pretty close to those for <code>check_markers</code>.
        The one parameter I am changing from default below is the <code>num_unknown</code> argument. This tells Garnett
        how many outgroup cells it should compare against. The default is 500, but in this toy dataset with so few cells
        we want fewer.

        After running train_cell_classifier, the output object, of type "garnett_classifier" contains all of the
        information necessary to classify cells.
      </p>


      <h3>Viewing the classification genes</h3>
      <p>
        Garnett classification is trained using a multinomial elastic-net regression. This means that certain genes are
        chosen as the relevant genes for distinguishing between cell types. Which genes are chosen may be of interest,
        so Garnett includes a function to access the chosen genes. Note: Garnett does not regularize the input markers,
        so they will be included in the classifier regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function we use to see the relevant genes is <code>get_feature_genes</code>. The arguments are the
        classifier, which node you'd like to view (if your tree is hierarchical) - use "root" for the top node and the
        parent cell type name for other nodes, and the <code>db</code> for your species. The function will
        automatically convert the gene IDs to SYMBOL, but you can leave them as ENSEMBL IDs by setting
        <code>convert_ids = FALSE</code>.
      </p>

feature_genes <- get_feature_genes(pbmc_classifier,
                                   node = "root",

      <h3>Viewing references</h3>
      <p>
        We explained <a href = "/garnett/docs/#constructing-a-marker-file">above</a> how to include documentation about
        how you chose your markers in your marker file. In order to get this information back out - to see how markers
        were chosen for an already trained classifier - use the function <code>get_classifier_references</code>. Besides
        the classifier, there is one additional optional argument called <code>cell_type</code>. If you pass the name
        of a cell type, only the references for that cell type will be printed, otherwise they will all be printed.

      <h3>Load your data</h3>
      <p>
        If you haven't loaded your data yet (because you're using a pre-trained classifier), now is the time!
      </p>
      <h4>The CellDataSet class</h4>
      <p>
        Because Garnett builds on <a href = "http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release">Monocle</a>, data for
        Garnett is held in objects of the <code><a href = "https://rdrr.io/bioc/monocle/man/CellDataSet.html">
        CellDataSet (CDS)</a></code> class. This class is derived from the Bioconductor <code>ExpressionSet</code>
        class, which provides a common interface familiar to those who have analyzed microarray experiments with
        Bioconductor. Monocle provides detailed documentation about how to generate an input CDS
        <a href = "http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/docs/#the-celldataset-class">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, Garnett includes a small dataset derived from the PBMC 10x V1 expression
        <a href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/">data</a> [1].
      </p>

mat <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "exprs.txt", package = "garnett"),
                  check.names = FALSE)
fdata <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "fdata.txt", package = "garnett"))
pdata <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "pdata.txt", package = "garnett"),

{% endhighlight %}
      <p>
        Once you've got your classifier, it's time to classify your cells using the <code>classify_cells</code>
        function! The key arguments are:
        <ul>
          <li><code>cds</code>: This is the CDS object containing your gene expression data (see above).</li>
          <li><code>classifier</code>: This the the garnett_classifier you obtained above.</li>
            <li><code>db</code>: <code>db</code> is a required argument for a Bioconductor AnnotationDb-class package used
              for converting gene IDs. For example, for humans use <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.8/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html">org.Hs.eg.db</a>. See available packages at the
              <a href = "http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.8/data/annotation/">Bioconductor website</a>. Load your
              chosen db using <code>library(db)</code>.</li>
              <li><code>cluster_extend</code>: This tells Garnett whether to create a second set of assignments that 
              expands classifications to cells in the same cluster. You can either provide cluster IDs in the pData 
              table in a column titled "garnett_cluster", or you can let Garnett calculate the clusters and populate 
              the column. <div class= "panel panel-danger"><emph>Warning:</emph> if not providing a "garnett_cluster" column and setting 
              <code>cluster_extend</code> to <code>TRUE</code> with a very large dataset, this function will slow 
              down considerably. For convenience, Garnett will save the clusters it calculates to "garnett_cluster", so 
              the function will be faster if run again.</div></li>
              <li><code>cds_gene_id_type</code>: This argument tells Garnett the format of the gene IDs in your CDS object.
            It should be one of the values in <code>columns(db)</code>. The default is "ENSEMBL".</li>
          </ul>

          The <code>classify_cells</code> function returns the input CDS object with one (or two if 
          <code>cluster_extend = TRUE</code>) new columns in the pData table containing the Garnett 
          classifications.

<p>
  The top plot above shows Garnett's cell type assignments, and the second plot show Garnett's cluster-extended type 
  assignments. You can see that the T cell subsets (CD4 and CD8) are not well separated in these clusters, so when the 
  cluster-extended type is calculated, Garnett backs up the hierarchy to the more confident assignment of "T cells".
</p>
<p>
  Because this example data is from a FACS sorted cell sample, we can compare Garnett's assignments to the "true" cell
  types.
