        <h3 data-toc-skip>Supervised Classification Enables Rapid Annotation of Cell Atlases</h3>

          Single cell technologies for profiling tissues or even entire organisms are rapidly achieving ubiquity. 
          However, the manual process by which cell types are typically annotated in the resulting data is 
          labor-intensive and increasingly rate-limiting for the field. Here we describe Garnett, an algorithm and 
          accompanying software for rapidly annotating cell types in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, based on an 
          interpretable, hierarchical markup language of cell type-specific genes. Garnett successfully classifies cell 
          types in tissue and whole organism datasets, as well as across species.
